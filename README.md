# 📘 0x04-TypeScript

Welcome to the **TypeScript journey** under the **ALX Front-End Specialization**. This repository contains a series of modular tasks from **Task 0 to Task 5** focused on mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft.

Each task is isolated in its own folder (`task_0` to `task_5`) and explores a key area of TypeScript, such as types, functions, interfaces, modules, object-oriented patterns, and nominal typing using brand conventions.
